# The-Gold-Bar-Dilemma
You have twelve identical-looking gold bars, but one of them is counterfeit and weighs slightly less than the others. You also have a balance scale, which you can use only three times. Can you determine which gold bar is counterfeit and whether it is lighter or heavier?

Solution:
To solve this puzzle, follow these steps:

Divide the twelve gold bars into three groups of four bars each: Group A, Group B, and Group C.

Weigh Group A against Group B on the balance scale:
a. If they balance, the counterfeit bar is in Group C. Proceed to step 3.
b. If they don't balance, proceed to step 3.

Take the heavier group (let's assume it's Group A) and select any two bars from it. Weigh these two bars against each other on the balance scale:
a. If they balance, the counterfeit bar is the remaining one in Group A, and it is heavier or lighter depending on the previous weighing.
b. If they don't balance, the heavier bar of the two being weighed is the counterfeit one.

Using this approach, you can identify the counterfeit gold bar and determine whether it is lighter or heavier using the balance scale in just three weighings.
